While this script was tested and working in my environment, it is vital that you test it in a test environment before using in your production environment.  I am not responsible for any outcome that arises from you using these scripts.

My GitHub repositories are really just a collection of scripts and tools I've found and amended to suit my purposes or ones I've attempted to write from scratch to fulfill a requirement I've had at a particular time.

I started to use GitHub as I realised that I needed somewhere I could keep code so I could refer back to, to jog my memory on how to do things or to reuse so that I wasn't reinventing my wheel. (I say 'my' wheel as I'm not arrogant enough to think that any of my scripts could be 'the' wheel.)  

Also any suggestions on improvements to these scripts or better ways to do things are greatly appreciated. We're all standing on the shoulders on giants..... and I need more giants!
